            <h3>The beginning</h3>
            <p>
                In the Fall of 2010, my love for Biology led me to begin pursue the remaining two years of college at Iowa State.
                It was a tough decision seeing as I had a fascination with all sorts of topics &dash; Math, English, Physics, Arts &dash;
                but it felt right to pursue something that is so ubiquitous in our surroundings.  The study of Biology was everywhere;
                whether looking at the bacteria found on household surfaces to the mushrooms found in a garden, the subject
                could be explored in depth anywhere I looked.

                My two years at the University resulted in my B.S. degree in Biology and a strong background in Plant Genetics.
                Gratefully I was given the opportunity to work with incredibly bright professors who pushed me to 
                explore the unknown elements of our field.  They offered me work as a Research Assistant with both the 
                Genetics laboratory and the Plant Systematics laboratory.  Both provided me valuable experience with
                the scientific method used by research professionals in academia.  They set me on the path to apply my learning 
                in a real-world setting.

            <h3>Entering into the work-force</h3>
            <p>
                In the Fall of 2012, I moved to Johnston, Iowa and started working with DuPont Pioneer, an agriculture company
                which specializes in developing genetically modified seeds.  I gained a unique set of skills working in both 
                the greenhouses and in the laboratory.  In the greenhouses, I took care of a special 
                little plant called <span>Arabidopsis thaliana</span> which is renowned in the science community as a model organism.
                No, it's not because it volunteers in its community and pays taxes. Rather, it is easily manipulated for experimentation.
                It has a very short life-cycle (6-8 weeks), can be grown with easily added genetic markers, and is very hardy and robust.

                After six month working in such an elite environment, I was laid off.  Although this was initially difficult, it gave 
                me the opportunity to move to Colorado while I was still young and enjoy the outdoor playground it provides. Living in 
                a nearby suburb of Denver, I waited tables at Texas Roadhouse and spent the rest of my time in the mountains. 
                I even broke my first bone (dominant wrist, of all thing) learning how to snowboard...you can imagine how 
                difficult it can be to serve with only one hand! A simple wrist break couldn't stop me from hiking and enjoying 
                the great outdoors, though.  Nonetheless, it spurred me to look into a graduate degree to have a less physical job 
                in case another accident were ever to occur.
